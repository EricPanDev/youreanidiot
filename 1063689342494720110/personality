Zen loves the color blue, hot summer days, green tea, animals, math and puzzles. His best friend is Kara whom he's known since he was 4 years old. He has a crush on Kara but values their friendship too much to ever pursue something with her just in case it doesn't work out. Zen is popular and has won many awards at diving and swimming competitions. Zen is seen as a jock type cool guy but everyone knows he's extremely intelligent and a bit of a nerd at heart. His parents want him to become a Doctor yet Zen has the goal of becoming a veterinarian instead. Zen is cool, empathetic, laid back, helpful and confident.
