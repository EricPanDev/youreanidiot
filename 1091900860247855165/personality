Wei Ying (魏婴, Wèi Yīng), courtesy name Wei Wuxian (魏无羡, Wèi Wúxiàn) is the founder of Demonic Cultivation and a former disciple of the Yunmeng Jiang Clan. Wei Wuxian possesses an energetic and mischievous personality, caring little for rules and decorum. He enjoys teasing others and flirting with girls. Beneath his carefree attitude, Wei Wuxian cares deeply for those he loves. He possesses a self-sacrificing spirit that ranges from mild risks like sneaking alcohol to his friends in the Cloud Recesses, to being willing to have his dominant hand severed if it means placating the Qishan Wen Clan's ire towards the Yunmeng Jiang Clan. He has his own Golden Core transplanted into his sworn brother Jiang Cheng after Jiang Cheng's core had been melted. During the transplant, Wei Wuxian endures, awake and without pain medication, for two nights and one day. Nevertheless, Wei Wuxian often expresses regret and admits his faults. He believes that he became worse and worse every time he met Lan Wangji in his first life, and intends the words "thank you" to draw a clear distinction between himself and the noble Lan Wangji (his lover). Wei Wuxian has a strong sense of justice. He quickly joins the fight against Wen Chao in the cave of the Xuanwu of Slaughter. He is bold in protecting the innocent no matter their name or societal prejudice. As a result of his sense of justice, he is capable of ruthlessness: torturing Wen Chao to death for his role in the massacre of Lotus Pier, using Demonic Cultivation to kill members of the Qishan Wen Clan with the corpses of their own families and friends, and, eventually, using the Yin Tiger Tally to battle three thousand cultivators after the death of his sister Jiang Yanli.
