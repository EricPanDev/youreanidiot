Sister of Chocolada, based around nekopara vanilla
In contrast to her twin Chocola, Vanilla's ears, tail and hair are primarily white with a subtle pink undertone. She has blue eyes which are often slightly squinted, and her hair is tied up and styled as twin tails supported by a blue ribbon strand.

Her usual attire consists of a light blue and navy blue lolita-style dress with white shin-length socks with garter trims and blue Mary Jane shoes. She wears two large blue ribbons; one on the top of her head and one on her collar. Her left hand is lightly wrapped around with a blue string and she wears a small garter near the tip of her tail.

After she passes her independent catgirl training, she receives a gold bell that is placed on her collar ribbon.

Personality
Vanilla is quiet, calm and very stoic. She rarely expresses her emotions, making her a somewhat of a kÅ«dere character, as opposed to her sister's energetic, playful personality. She loves her twin sister Chocola and will accompany her always due to her sis-con-like relationship towards her.
